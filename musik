Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, I do, I do now
I see my body in a different light, I-I-I
As if I woke up in a different life, I-I-I
Feels like I'm walking with my heart on fire
Somebody pass me the water
'Cause I'm burning
'Cause a little bit sooner turned into a lot
There's no way I'd be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought that I was not
Tell me, tell me, I-I-I
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, what do I do now?
I've never felt so good, I feel so soft, na-na-na
And now I know it's heaven on my spots, na-na-na
I didn't know that I could have these thoughts, yeah-yeah
Somebody pass me the water
'Cause I'm burning
(Take a lot)
'Cause a little bit sooner turned into a lot
There's no way I'd be turning the feeling off
Guess I'm everything that I thought that I was not
Tell me, tell me, I-I-I
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, what do I do now?
Everything I thought I knew about me's upside down
Everything is changing but I think I love it now, I-I-I
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Don't know what this is
What do I do now, do now, do now?
Do with all of this?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh, what do I do now?
All of these new emotions
I let them out in the open
Oh mama, oh la, oh la, oh la
Oh what do I do now?

-----------Diamond Heart-------------
Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
Like I'm drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable
I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
(If I had a diamond heart) I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
If
Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made up
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable
I wish that I did not know (Ooh)
Where all broken lovers go (Ooh)
I wish that my heart was made of stone
(I wish that my heart was made of stone)
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable
I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got
(If I had a diamond heart) I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
This is the story
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'd give you all my love (I'd give you)
If I was unbreakable
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You could shoot me with a gun of gold (You could shoot)
If I was unbreakable
I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I got (If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Ai ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai

Nanimo motazu ni umareochita boku
Towa no sukima de notauchimawatteru
Akirameta mono to kashikoi mono dake ga
Shousha no jidai ni doko de iki wo suu

Shihaisha mo kami mo dokoka taningao
Dakedo hontou wa wakatteru hazu
Yuuki ya kibou ya kizuna to ka no mahou
Tsukaimichi mo naku otona wa me wo somukeru
Sore demo ano hi no kimi ga ima mo mada
Boku no zen seigi no domannaka ni iru

Sekai ga senaka wo muketemo mada nao
Tachimukau kimi ga ima mo koko ni iru

Ai ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai
Boku ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai

Kimi ga kureta yuuki dakara
Kimi no tame ni tsukaitain da
Kimi to wakeatta ai dakara
Kimi to janakya imi ga nain da
Ai ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai
Boku ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai

Sadame to wa tsumari saikoro no deta me
Hatamata kami no itsumo no kimagure
Erabi erabareta nugerarenu yoroi
Moshiku wa haruka na yuragu koto nai ishi
Hatasanu negai to kanawanu saikai to

Kimi to sodateta ai dakara
Kimi to ja nakya imi ga nain da
Ai ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai
Boku ni dekiru koto wa mada aru kai

Nanimo nai bokutachi ni naze yume wo misaseta ka
Owari aru jinsei ni naze kibou wo motaseta ka
Naze kono te wo surinukeru mono bakari ataeta ka
Sore demo nao shigamitsuku bokura wa minikui kai
Soretomo kirei kai kotaete yo

Ai no uta mo utawaretsukushita
Suuta no eiga de katararetsukushita
Sonna kouya ni umareochita boku, kimi sore demo
